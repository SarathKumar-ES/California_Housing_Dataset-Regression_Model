# California_Housing_Dataset-Regression_Model
This project aims to analyze and predict housing prices in California using the built-in fetch_california_housing dataset from Scikit-learn. Multiple regression models were implemented, evaluated, and compared to identify the best-performing one.

🔍 Objective
To apply various regression algorithms and evaluate their performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

📌 Models Used
Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

📊 Results
After evaluation, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor showed the best performance based on R² score, making them ideal for this prediction task.
